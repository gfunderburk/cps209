# CPS 209 Team 1 - Terminator Salvation 2  

## Instructions: 
Use your mouse to shoot your gun at hostiles, and click the reload button when your magazine is empty to refill you gun's rounds. Power-ups can also be shot at, and they are scattered throughout the world. They can: refill depleted health, refill depleted ammunition, or give you extra points.  The cheat-mode toggles whether cheat-mode is active or not. If it is active, the player cannot die, the player get unlimited ammunition, and the player's attacks do increased damage.
