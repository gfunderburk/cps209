Schaub, Stephen,
Situation:
  
The requirements today ask that we implement basic unit tests for both our data (highscore + serial) and our Game model.
 
We successfully have our data model unit tests, but we are unsure how to unit test the game model currently. 
 
The Game model has 3 main parts:  
1: Entity Classes (Player and Hostile AI),
2: Entity Abstract Classes,
3: and a Game.java class (similar to World.java in Prog. 5)
 
Since the Game.java class primarily just changes game STATES (GameState = PAUSED, GameState = PLAY), it does not seem to support a lot of unit testing right now. The abstract classes don't seem unit testing friendly either...
 

Question: 

Since we have unit tests for the Data Model, at this stage of the project, do we also need unit tests for the not-unit-test-freindly Game Model?
