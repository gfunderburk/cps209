## I. Player Entity

**Level Design:** The game will be a first-person shooter played within a static 2.5D screen. The world will be several 2-D x,y-axis planes layered infront of each other, creating a layered z-axis effect. Hostiles and world scenery will exist on and move around on these planes.

**Character:** The player will not have a body and will not move. He will exclusively be a screen looking onto a world with a controlable cursor. The player can use his mouse to move the cursor around and click to fire his firearm at displayed gameworld objects. For the base version of the game, the player will be able to crouch downwards, but will not be able to move. For extra credit, movement control will be added so that the player can walk sideways. The player can recover lost health by crouching down behind a provided barrier for protection.

**Controls:** 

- [Rightclick] = shoot firearm.
- [Leftclick] = toggle equiped firearm.
- [R] = reload equiped firearm.
- [W] = stand up.
- [S] = crouch down.
- [ESC] = enter/exit ESC Menu.
- Hold [C] for 1.5 sec. = toggle cheatMode.
(Extra Credit) 
- [A] = skoot left.
- [D] = skoot right. 

**Player HUD:** The player's health, rounds in magazine, total ammo count, currently equiped weapon, types & count of hostiles remaining, cheatMode active state, and standing/crouching position will be displayed graphically on the player's screen.


## II. Other Entities

**World Objects:** The world will contain the following objects.

- Barriers will be static and non-destructable. They will visually cover other items and hostiles behind itself, and it will block both projectiles and entityies from moving through itself.
- Walls will act as barriers, but they will be destructable.
- Crates will be like walls, but upon being destroyed, the crates may reveal (may turn into) power-ups.
- Power-ups will provide the player things like score points and ammunition upon being successfully shot by the player's mouse-cursor. Power-ups will not prevent hostiles from going through them.

**Hostile Entities:** Hostiles will have AI capabilites that will at a minimum include but not be limited to the following.

- AI's can independently move around the 2.5D layered world, properly recognizing obstucting barriers/walls/crates.
- AI's will recognize and attack the player.
- AI's will run out of magazine rounds and need to reload.

**Projectiles:** AI's and the player will create projectiles(bullets) to fire at each other. Projectiles will function accordingly.

- a target 3-space coordinate will be selected.
- a 3-space vector will be calculated, spanning the distance between the firing Entity and the target.
- the vector will have its raduis shortened to the projectile's speed.
- every frame, the projectile's current 3-space location will be updated by adding the vector to the self-location.
- after self-updating its location, the projectile will check its distance from every other entity in the game model.
- if its distance with a given entity equals 0, both the projectile and the collided entity will trigger their respective collision events.
- NOTE: if the projectile never collides and leaves the boundary of the game, the projectile will despawn.


## III. Game Functionality

**Level Progression:** The game will have 3 levels. The player will conclude each level by either neutralizing all hostiles or by dying himself. If the hostiles are neutralized, a success pop-up screen appears and the player either procceeds to the next level or he goes to the end-game highscore screen. If the player dies, he is sent straight to the highscore screen after a failure pop-up screen.

**Scoring:** The player will earn points by killings hostiles, shooting point power-ups, and completing each level within a timelimit.

**Difficulty:** There are 3 following difficulty settings.

- Easy = low enemy count, 1.0x enemy damage to player, core AI features.
- Medium = medium enemy count, 1.3x enemy damage to player, (Extra credit) AI's use special attacks sporadically.
- Hard = high enemy count, 1.6x enemy damage to player, (Extra credit) AI's seek out and crouch behind barriers.

**Cheat Mode:** If cheatMode is active, the player will have unlimited health, ammo, and his rounds instantly kill hostiles.

**Compatability:** The game will be designed to operate on all Windows 10 x64 machines and will work on a 1440x900 display. It will be built using Java and JavaFX.
